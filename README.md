Unfortunetely due to lack of time there is still a room for improvements. The things that I'd like to improve:

-   tests for async operations,
-   moving API calls to seperatare services,
-   better UX (loader indicators, cleaner way to present data in details view),
-   introduce debouncing on search input,
-   cancel API call on multiple clicks using abortCotroller or disable button if call is pending.
